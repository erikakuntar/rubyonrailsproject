From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-on-rails?ref=lnav

For this project I'll be following a tutorial and working through setting up a ruby-on-rails project.
I will be working through error messages to learn workflow and user errors.
I will also be learning about orphaned tagging and referential integrity in this tutorial.
As the last step, I will deploy my app to Heroku.

This app can be found on Heroku at https://sheltered-brushlands-66330.herokuapp.com/
